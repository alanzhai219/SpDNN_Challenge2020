# Dataset 
There are two ways to get the dataset. 

## Option 1
We provide converted files that are dervied from the Graph Challenge website over a Box. This can be downloaded from (Total of ~90GB): 
[BoxFolder](https://uofi.box.com/s/gseet60dz0f939r6n69veggn80i9twwh)

After download is complete, untar all the files present inside the dataset. 

## Option 2
Automatic download and compilation (requires gzip and tar support).
Space Required: ~200GB. Post processing ~90GB. 

We assume you have set PROJREPO environment variable to the repo home. 

```
git clone https://github.com/merthidayetoglu/SpDNN_Challenge2020.git
cd SpDNN_Challenge2020
export PROJREPO=$PWD
mkdir dataset
cd dataset
bash $PROJREPO/utils/download.sh
```
# Dependencies
